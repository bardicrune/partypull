# partypull
This Addon for Ashita-v4 is designed to send a message to the party when you pull a mob.  It was inspired and sourced from by Atom0s's checker addon included with the Ashita-v4 beta.

## FFXI commands:
/pull - Checks the targeted entity and sends a message to the party including entity level, difficulty rating, and defense/evasion ratings.

/pull help - Displays a help message.
